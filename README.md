JS GIT HOOKS
============

A small script to use as git hooks. It checks modified files.

Not a lot of features, it fits my needs.

**WARNING**
-----------

Npm post install script will remove previous pre-commit and pre-push scripts.
Copy them elsewhere and  use a .jshooksrc to define multiple commands to run as hooks: 
[.jshooksrc](.jshooksrc)
